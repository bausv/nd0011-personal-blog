      Cumulonimbus (from Latin cumulus, "heaped" and nimbus, "rainstorm") is a dense, towering vertical cloud, typically forming from water vapor condensing in the lower troposphere that builds upward
      carried by powerful buoyant air currents. Above the lower portions of the cumulonimbus the water vapor becomes ice crystals, such as snow and graupel, the interaction of which can lead to hail
      and to lightning formation, respectively. When occurring as a thunderstorm these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads. Cumulonimbus can form alone, in clusters, or along squall lines. These
      clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather, such as tornadoes, hazardous winds, and large hailstones. Cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus
      clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell. Cumulonimbus is abbreviated Cb.

      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller cumulus clouds. The cumulonimbus base may extend several kilometres (miles) across, or be as small as several tens of metres
         (yards) across, and occupy low to upper altitudes within the troposphere - formed at altitude from approximately 200 to 4,000 m (700 to 10,000 ft). Peaks typically reach to as much as 12,000
         m (39,000 ft), with extreme instances as high as 21,000 m (69,000 ft) or more. Well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat, anvil-like top (anvil dome), caused by wind
         shear or inversion at the equilibrium level near the tropopause. The shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud's vertical component for many kilometres (miles), and be accompanied by
         lightning. Occasionally, rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level (due to momentum) and form an overshooting top culminating at the maximum parcel level. When vertically developed,
         this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions. Even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison.</p>

      <h2>Supplementary features</h2>
      <h3>Accessory clouds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Arcus (including roll and shelf clouds): low, horizontal cloud formation associated with the leading edge of thunderstorm outflow.</li>
        <li>Pannus: accompanied by a lower layer of fractus species cloud forming in precipitation.</li>
        <li>Pileus (species calvus only): small cap-like cloud over parent cumulonimbus.</li>
        <li>Velum: a thin horizontal sheet that forms around the middle of a cumulonimbus.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Supplementary features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Incus (species capillatus only): cumulonimbus with flat anvil-like cirriform top caused by wind shear where the rising air currents hit the inversion layer at the tropopause.</li>
        <li>Mamma or mammatus: consisting of bubble-like protrusions on the underside.</li>
        <li>Tuba: column hanging from the cloud base which can develop into a funnel cloud or tornado. They are known to drop very low, sometimes just 6 metres (20 ft) above ground level.</li>
        <li>Flanking line is a line of small cumulonimbus or cumulus generally associated with severe thunderstorms.</li>
        <li>An overshooting top is a dome that rises above the thunderstorm; it is associated with severe weather.</li>
      </ul>
